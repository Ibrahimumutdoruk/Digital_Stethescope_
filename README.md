  The main goal of this  project is to build an electronic stethoscope system to acquire the acoustic
sound that is coming from various parts of the body and convert that sound to a digital signal. These
electronic signals can be further processed and digitalized to transmit to a personal computer or a
laptop by using Arduino.  These are MATLAB codes that we used in our project .
